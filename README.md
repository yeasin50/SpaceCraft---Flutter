 A simple game, wanna impliment in flutter. 
 

should I implement provider for this simple like this manager

[Audio manager usung assets_audio_player](https://pub.dev/packages/assets_audio_player/example)


## ⚠ For game you should use [Flame package](https://pub.dev/packages/flame)
## Getting Started

Implementation Explosion on gets laggy, So lets try on Start Ui, because there will be less operation.   
I may also changed rive animation type. Maybe check without provider or using custom paint 
for shoot and Possition , lets use provider

[FireBase dep. ](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/migration/)
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

[Animation Curve](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html)

## ⚠ Debuging is Much laggy, avoid debug statements on forEach loop. 
Thought It might be because we are changing a lot, but sometimes it's just happen because of print/debug statements. 
Now lets add Explosions Rives on it, Not sure about how it gonna perform.
